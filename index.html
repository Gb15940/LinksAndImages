    <p>
        Five Nights at Freddy's 3 is the third installment to the franchise.
        <br>The game has a somewhat steady gameplay with one animatronic and "The phantoms", but it does contain a lot of lore useful for the series.
        <br>An example would be Springtrap himself, as this is where we learn a lot more about him through minigames.
        <br>There are multiple secrets hidden everywhere, like a numpad in the wall and playing an arcade through the cameras, which is a cool feature.

    <p>
        Fnaf world was a very interesting addon to the games, later becoming noncanon however, but theorists still use it for the lore it has.
        <br>The gameplay is completely different from the other games as it is instead an RPG and not a game where you sit in one spot and check cameras.
        <br>Later, after beating the game, it brings you to a cutscene showing Henry Emily, one of the founders of Freddys, seemingly committing.
        <br>There are so many layers to this specific game that I cannot cover in my head, but it's super interesting to explore all the secrets.

    <p>
        Sister location is the 5th game in the FNaF franchise, it includes some major lore like the fact that Purple guy's name is William Afton.
        <br>It also reveals that he had kids, had a wife, and it seems like he has his own company seperate from Fazbears.
        <br>In the secret minigame you can find after dying, you play as Circus Baby and if you do it the correct way, you'll head back to the beginning and find out that Circus baby is actually a murderer and killed William Aftons child, Elizabeth.
